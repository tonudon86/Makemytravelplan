    							<ul>
	    							<li><b>Day 01:</b>Arrive Dubai – Evening Dhow Cruise</li>
	    							<li>Arrive Dubai in style and proceed to the outside gate to meet our representative to be transferred to your favorite choice of hotel. Capture the first glances of the dazzling city Dubai. On reaching the hotel, complete your check-in formalities (according to hotel’s check-in time) and relax in your room. As the flight is reaching in the morning, you may opt for an early check-in (at an additional cost). Stretch out and remove your jet lag. Today is a good time to go shopping at the modern malls or the traditional souks. Visit the famous Gold Souk, best place for the ones who have interest in jewellery. Dubai is famous for its extensive world class malls with all the latest fashion, designs and technology, teeming with top brands and addictive designer boutiques. Or else, you could just laze in your bed and enjoy the luxuries of your hotel. Get ready in the evening for an exciting time on Dhow Cruise. Cruise over the Dubai creek in a traditional wooden boat. Spend cozy moments with your beloved under the starlit sky and indulge in a sumptuous dinner served to you in perfect Arabic hospitality. After a truly romantic evening, return to hotel and retire to deep slumber. Stay overnight at the hotel.</li>
	    							<li><b>Day 02:</b>Dubai – Desert Safari </li>
									<li>After a breakfast at hotel half day at leisure for shopping and evening later get ready for the exciting Desert Safari, the biggest attraction of Dubai. Sit back in your four- wheeler and enjoy a roller-coaster ride on the sand dunes. Dune bashing is a great fun and thrill to experience. Stand at the highest dune to capture the beauty of setting sun over the golden sands. You can also opt for a camel ride if you want and ladies will be enthralled to get beautiful henna designs on their hands. After desert safari, it’s time for barbecue dinner and a belly dance performance. Later return to the hotel for a relaxed sleep. Stay overnight at hotel in Dubai.</li>
									<li><b>Day 03:</b> Dubai City Tour + Burj Kalifa</li>
									<li>After a breakfast at hotel, set out for a half day city tour of Dubai. On the tour, visit the prominent landmarks of the place such as Burj Al Arab- the most famous landmark of Dubai, Jumeirah along with Jumeirah Mosque and witness Dubai’s age old culture at Al Fahidi Fort, home to Dubai’s famous museum among a few more attractions that we will counter while on our tour. After the city tour, afternoon proceed for the Burj Kalifa – However, we suggest that you take this opportunity to visit Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building pierces the sky at 828m (seven times the height of Big Ben) and opened on 4 January 2010, only six years after excavations began. The main attraction is the Observation Deck ‘At the Top’ on the 124th floor. From such lofty heights you can easily pinpoint The World, the three Palm developments and other landmarks. Getting there takes you past various multimedia exhibits to a double-deck lift that whisks you 10m per second for an entire minute to reach level 124 at a lofty 442m in the air. Late evening back to hotel. Stay overnight at hotel in Dubai.</li>
									<li><b>Day 04:</b> Dubai – Departure</li>
									<li>Have a fill at breakfast, pack your bags and check out from the hotel. Keep your bags safe at the reception and set out to grab as many last moments at this golden land as you can. The flight being at night, you can grab onto some left shopping deals or spend leisurely time at the Jumeirah Beach. Wait! Have you taken souvenirs for your loved ones waiting for you back home? After stealing some more moments from time here, it’s time to bid byes to Dubai. We hope you have a lot of memories to cherish for a long time. We’ll be so much glad to have your feedback of the trip after your return. Tran,sfer to the airport for your return flight.</li>
